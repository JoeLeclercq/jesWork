@title@ @release@ for Mac OS X
============================================================
@title@ is a development environment designed for [Media Computation][].
It allows students to use the Python programming language (specifically,
Jython, which is a version of Python implemented in Java) to manipulate
images, sounds, and videos.

JES is incorporated in "Introduction to Computing and Programming in Python:
A Multimedia Approach," by Mark Guzdial and Barbara Ericson. Dr. Guzdial
is the project leader, and the project has been worked on by many people
over the years.

@title@ is Free Software, made available under the GNU General Public License.
This means that everyone may use JES, free of charge, and share it with
anyone. Everyone can also make changes to JES and share those changes.

Requirements
------------
This is the Mac OS X package of @title@. It will work on any Mac OS X
system, as long as a Java Runtime Environment is installed.

* On OS X 10.6 and below, Java is included in the operating system..
* On OS X 10.7 and above, Java is no longer included in the operating system.
  If Java has not already been installed on your computer,
  you will need to download Java from <https://www.java.com/en/download/>.

For more information about Java on Mac OS X,
see <https://www.java.com/en/download/faq/java_mac.xml>.


Running @title@
-----------
In many cases, you can start @title@ simply by double-clicking the
"@title@" application icon. (You can copy it into your Applications folder,
if you like.) If you downloaded it from the Internet, it may ask you
whether or not you want to really want to open it first.

However, if you are running a recent version of Mac OS X, Gatekeeper
may prevent you from opening @title@, warning you that @title@ was
not released by a recognized developer, or that it was not downloaded from
the Mac App Store. To open it, hold Control and click on the "@title@"
application icon, and select "Open" from the menu. OS X will then ask you
if you want to open it, and you can select "Open."

(This isn't because @title@ is unsafe, but because it is developed by a
university professor with many other projects, obtaining a Developer ID
is too complicated and expensive.)
