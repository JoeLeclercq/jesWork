        <h1>@title@ version @release@ &ndash; Downloads</h1>

        <p>
            @title@ is a development environment designed for
            <a href="http://mediacomputation.org/">Media Computation</a>.
            It allows students to use the Python programming language
            (specifically, Jython, which is a version of Python implemented
            in Java) to manipulate images, sounds, and videos.
        </p>

        <p>
            JES is incorporated in &ldquo;Introduction to Computing and
            Programming in Python: A Multimedia Approach,&rdquo;
            by Mark Guzdial and Barbara Ericson. Dr. Guzdial
            is the project leader, and the project has been worked on by
            many people over the years.

        <p>
            If Java is not included, consult your system documentation
            for installation instructions. Any version of Java 1.5.0
            or higher will suffice.
        </p>

        <p>
            While we don't have the resources for extensive compatibility
            testing, we believe that JES will work on any currently-supported
            OS release and CPU architecture, as long as Java is available.
        </p>

        <p>
            We also provide a testing kit, for testing or debugging JES:
            <a href="@basename@-@release@-testkit.zip">@basename@-@release@-testkit.zip</a>.
            It includes copies of JES's unit tests, demo scripts,
            and a test plan. (The testing kit is cross-platform.)
