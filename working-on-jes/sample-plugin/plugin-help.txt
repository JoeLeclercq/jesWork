JES Plugin Creation Kit
=======================
This directory contains everything you need to make your own JES plugin!
To use it, you need a copy of Apache Ant (http://ant.apache.org/).
The basic steps are:

1.  Copy this directory tree.
2.  Edit the `plugin.properties` file and `README.txt`.
3.  Delete the `python/greetings.py` file, and place your plugin's code,
    documentation, and other resources in the directories provided.
4.  Run `ant`.
5.  Open up JES and install the plugin `.jar` file,
    or copy it directly into the JES plugin directory for speed.
6.  Once you have it at a point you like,
    take the `.zip` file and share it with your friends!
    (You should also put the plugin code on GitHub.)

All the directories have `plugin-help.txt` files explaining what they do,
but here's quick summary. For stuff that's part of the plugin:

* `python` is for Python code.
* `java` is for Java code (just the source `.java` files).
* `jars` is for JAR files (they will get merged).
* `resources` is for other stuff that needs to end up in the JAR.

And stuff distributed along with the plugin:

* `demos` is for demo programs, and anything else you want.
* `help` is for detailed help files.
* You can also put any `*.txt` file in the plugin base directory
  (good for things like README's and licenses).

If you don't put things in these directories, they'll be ignored,
so you don't have to delete them.


Licensing
---------
The skeleton itself is released under the highly permissive MIT/X11 license.
The copyright notice is provided in the README.txt file, so make sure you
include it in your plugin, in addition to your own license file.

If you create a plugin that just contains code for JES programs to use,
without any reference to JES itself other than being a JES plugin,
it's (probably) not a derivative work of JES. So, you can release it
under any license compatible with the components.

However, if your plugin integrates with JES itself (for example, by adding
new menu items or overriding what happens at program load), it's almost
definitely a derivative work of JES. You will need to release it under the
GNU General Public License.
