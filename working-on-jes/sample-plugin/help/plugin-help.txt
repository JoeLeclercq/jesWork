This directory contains any detailed help files you want to include.
It will be included alongside the plugin .jar file in the .zip file.
(You can also put normal *.txt files in the plugin's main directory.)

If you don't place any files in this directory,
there will be no help/ directory in the .zip file.
(This one doesn't count.)
